These code is for an Inidividual Project in University of Southampton. Here is the project abstract: 

For commercial greenhouses or enthusiastic gardeners, hiring professionals to determine optimal growth conditions for their greenhouse can be effective in improving their plant’s quality. However, most gardeners do not have such luxury and they often struggle when aiming to achieve similar high-quality plant yields in their greenhouse. Therefore, this project aims to develop an IoT Mini Smart Greenhouse System that enhance gardening experience for everyone by allowing users to control and optimize their plant growth conditions intuitively. The prototype system developed in this project consist of three interconnected components: The “Mini Smart Greenhouse” equipped with advanced microclimate monitoring and control features, “Remote Greenhouse Management” which provides real-time data reporting and control via online platform, and a “Data Analysis Pipeline” for in-depth weekly data analysis. Furthermore, a rigorous 30-day controlled testing period was conducted to evaluate the system’s effectiveness. Results proves that by controlling the greenhouse’s microclimate with the Mini Smart Greenhouse and continuously adjusting system setting with the data analysis pipeline, it has significantly accelerated plant growth by 24%. Hence, proved to be a comprehensive and successful solution for gardeners of all levels.
